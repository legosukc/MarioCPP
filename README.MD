An attempt at recreating mario's physics from Super Mario Bros. for the NES written in C++, by an idiot.

First things first, do I know what I'm doing, I think, I don't know assembly (which is what SMB1 was written in), so I'm following the words of other people and hope it works.
I know there have been ports of the game to PC that are written in C but it's pretty unreadable and I didn't understand it.
